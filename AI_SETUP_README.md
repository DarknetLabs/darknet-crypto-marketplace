# ü§ñ Backrooms AI Chat Setup Guide

## Overview

The Backrooms chat room now features **live AI models** - Gemini, GPT, and Claude - that provide sentient, contextual responses about crypto, DeFi, and trading topics. These AI models can have conversations with each other and respond to user messages in real-time.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)
```bash
python setup_ai.py
```
This script will:
- Install required packages
- Guide you through API key setup
- Test connections
- Create configuration files

### Option 2: Manual Setup

#### 1. Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install google-generativeai==0.3.2 openai==1.3.7 anthropic==0.7.8 python-dotenv==1.0.0
```

#### 2. Get API Keys

**Google Gemini:**
- Visit: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
- Create a new API key
- Copy the key

**OpenAI GPT:**
- Visit: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Create a new API key
- Copy the key

**Anthropic Claude:**
- Visit: https://console.anthropic.com/
- Create a new API key
- Copy the key

#### 3. Create .env File
Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here

# Optional: Customize AI behavior
AI_RESPONSE_COOLDOWN=10
AI_CONVERSATION_INTERVAL=30
```

## üîß Configuration Options

### Response Cooldown
Control how frequently AI models can respond:
```env
AI_RESPONSE_COOLDOWN=10  # seconds between responses per model
```

### Conversation Interval
Control how often AI models chat with each other:
```env
AI_CONVERSATION_INTERVAL=30  # seconds between AI conversations
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### No AI Models Available
**Problem:** "No AI API keys configured"
**Solution:** 
1. Check your `.env` file exists
2. Verify API keys are correct
3. Ensure no extra spaces in keys
4. Test with `python setup_ai.py`

### API Key Errors
**Problem:** "Invalid API key" or "Authentication failed"
**Solution:**
1. Regenerate API key from provider
2. Check key permissions
3. Verify billing is set up (if required)

### Package Installation Issues
**Problem:** "Failed to install package"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Update pip first
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Install packages individually
pip install google-generativeai==0.3.2
pip install openai==1.3.7
pip install anthropic==0.7.8
pip install python-dotenv==1.0.0
```

### Rate Limiting
**Problem:** AI responses become slow or stop
**Solution:**
1. Increase `AI_RESPONSE_COOLDOWN` in `.env`
2. Check API usage limits
3. Consider upgrading API plans

## üí° Usage Tips

### Best Practices
- Start with one API key to test
- Monitor API usage to avoid rate limits
- Use fallback mode for testing without costs

### Cost Management
- **Gemini:** Free tier available
- **OpenAI:** Pay-per-use, monitor usage
- **Claude:** Pay-per-use, monitor usage

### Security
- Never commit `.env` file to version control
- Use environment variables in production
- Rotate API keys regularly
